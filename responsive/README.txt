Lab 4: README
due 6 October 2015
Note: I used one extension token on this lab


What has been correctly implemented and what has not:

	- Showing specific portions of the image in regards to the width of the
	  screen of the browser is correctly implemented

	- I am not sure that multiple use of nearly same @media declaration is
	  acceptable, and thus proper recycling of code may have not been
	  correctly implemented
