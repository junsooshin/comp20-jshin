# Responsive

Comp 20 Lab 4

due 6 October 2015

## What has been correctly implemented and what has not:

- Showing specific portions of the image in regards to the width of the screen 
  of the browser is correctly implemented.

- I am not sure that multiple use of nearly same @media declaration is 
  acceptable, and thus proper recycling of code may have not been correctly 
  implemented.

## Acknowledgements:
