# Captain's Log

## What has been correctly implemented and what has not:
	
Printing out the input messages onto the screen with the human readable 
timestamps and the latest update showing on top has been implemented.

Using local storage so that the messages are preserved and redisplayed
on return to the page has been implemented.

I am not sure if I used enough jQuery.
