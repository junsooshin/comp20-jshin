Lab 7: README
due 5 November 2015

What has been correctly implemented and what has not:
	
	Printing out the input messages onto the screen with the human readable 
	timestamps and the latest update showing on top has been implemented.

	Using local storage so that the messages are preserved and redisplayed
	on return to the page has been implemented.

	I am not sure how much jQuery I used.
