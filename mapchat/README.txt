Assignment 2: README
due 29 October 2015
Note: I used an extension token for this assignment (2nd token this semester).

What has been correctly implemented and what has not:
	
	The following has been implemented:

	- Creating a CSS file, 
	- Retrieving my location via JavaScript navigator.geolocation object,
	- Sending my information (latitude, longitude, login, message) to datastore 
	  with all special characters in message properly encoded,
	- Displaying my location on the map with unique marker and info window,
	- Retrieving locations of people in the class,
	- Displaying locations of people in the class on the map and info window for 
	  each person containing login name, person's message, and distance in miles 
	  away from me.

	Writing a clean and reusable code with helpful comments has not been
	implemented.
