# Mapchat

by Jun Soo (Derek) Shin

Comp 20 Assignment 2

due 29 October 2015

## What has been correctly implemented and what has not:
	
- The following has been implemented:
	- Creating a CSS file, 
	- Retrieving my location via JavaScript navigator.geolocation object,
	- Sending my information (latitude, longitude, login, message) to datastore 
	  with all special characters in message properly encoded,
	- Displaying my location on the map with unique marker and info window,
	- Retrieving locations of people in the class,
	- Displaying locations of people in the class on the map and info window for 
	  each person containing login name, person's message, and distance in miles 
	  away from me.

- Writing a clean and reusable code with helpful comments has not been
  implemented.

## Acknowledgements:

- To use Ming's code that uses Google Maps API to get current latitude and
  longitude and shows a marker and a info window on a map.
  I directly copied this code.
