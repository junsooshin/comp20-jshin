	<h3>Security and Privacy Assessment of Client-Side and Server-Side</h3>
	<hr/>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>We have completed the Mapchat assignment, which was a client-side application, and its server-side application. However, we did not check for security vulnerabilities, so now we are trying to find and fix those problems.</p>

	<h2>Methodology</h2>
	<p>First, I did the "black-box" testing, which is performing attacks on the application before reading the source code. I used Postman application to send requests and checked the results on the hosted web page on <a href="https://vast-peak-9452.herokuapp.com">https://vast-peak-9452.herokuapp.com</a> and on the mongo database. Then, I looked at the source code to understand why certain issues happened. After reading the source code, I did "white-box" testing, which is testing the specific areas that looked suspicious from source code.</p>

	<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
	<p>Provide an overview of all the security and privacy issues you identified. This section should be written for non-technical managers who do not have technical expertise and do not have time to read the entire document. Write this section using lay language.</p>

	<h2>Issues Found</h2>

	<ol>

		<li><p><strong>Cross Origin Resource Scripting</strong></p>

		<ul>
			<li>The issue was found on <a href="https://vast-peak-9452.herokuapp.com">https://vast-peak-9452.herokuapp.com</a> which uses the 'GET / - Home, the root, the index' API. </li>
			<li>High: If some other users depend on the output of this website, an attacker put what they want into the database and effect the webpage that runs the app.</li>
			<li>Using Postman, I entered <code>&lt;script&gt;alert('Hey Steven');&lt;/script&gt;</code> as the value for the 'message' key. When loading web page, the alert box popped up. The value for message written on the screen was ' ', and in the database, the value for the message key was stored exactly as the entered input.</li>
			<li>Screenshots on what happened:</li>

			<td><img src="screenshot3.png" alt="logo1" title="What went into the database" /></td>
			<table>
			<tr>
			<td><img src="screenshot1.png" alt="logo1" title="After injection" /></td>
			<td><img src="screenshot2.png" alt="logo2" title="After clicking OK" /></td>
			</tr>
			</table>

			<li>We need to check for dangerous characters like the angled brackets by writing code like <code>if(/^[a-zA-Z0-9- ]*$/.test(str) == false) { response.send('{"error":"Whoops, something is wrong with your data!"}'); } </code> </li>
		</ul>

		</li>

		<li><p><strong>Allowing Non-numerical Values as Latitude and Longitude</strong></p>
		</li>

		<ul>
			<li>The issue was also found on <a href="https://vast-peak-9452.herokuapp.com">https://vast-peak-9452.herokuapp.com</a> which uses the 'GET / - Home, the root, the index' API.
			<li>Low: </li>


		</ul>

		<li><p><strong>Third Finding</strong></p>
		</li>

	</ol>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Let's conclude</p>
