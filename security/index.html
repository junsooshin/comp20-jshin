	<h1>Comp 20 Assignment 4</h1>
	<h3>Security and Privacy Assessment of Client-Side and Server-Side</h3>
	<hr/>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>We have completed the Mapchat assignment, which was a client-side application, and its server-side application. However, we did not check for security vulnerabilities, so now we are trying to find and fix those problems.</p>

	<h2>Methodology</h2>
	<p>First, I did the "black-box" testing, which is performing attacks on the application before reading the source code. I used Postman application to send requests and checked the results on the hosted web page on <a href="https://vast-peak-9452.herokuapp.com">https://vast-peak-9452.herokuapp.com</a> and on the mongo database. Then, I looked at the source code to understand why certain issues happened. After reading the source code, I did "white-box" testing, which is testing the specific areas that looked suspicious from source code.</p>

	<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
	<p>Since the application is related to the user's input, the vulnerabilites were found regarding that. The application filters a lot of the user input, but as my web programming professor used to say, "Don't never ever trust user input," it could be more strict.</p>

	<h2>Issues Found</h2>

	<ol>

		<li><p><strong>Injection of Script String</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>The issue was found on <a href="https://vast-peak-9452.herokuapp.com">https://vast-peak-9452.herokuapp.com</a> which uses the 'GET / - Home, the root, the index' API. </li>
			<li>High: If some other users depend on the output of this website, an attacker put what they want into the database and effect the webpage that runs the app.</li>
			<li>Using Postman, I entered <code>&lt;script&gt;alert('Hey Steven');&lt;/script&gt;</code> as the value for the 'message' key. When loading web page, the alert box popped up. The value for 'message' written on the screen was ' ', and in the database, the value for the message key was stored exactly as the entered input.</li>
			<li>Screenshots on what happened:</li>

			<td><img src="screenshot3.png" alt="Script went into the database" title="Script went into the database" /></td>
			<table>
			<tr>
			<td><img src="screenshot1.png" alt="After injection" title="After injection" /></td>
			<td><img src="screenshot2.png" alt="After clicking OK" title="After clicking OK" /></td>
			</tr>
			</table>

			<li>We need to check for dangerous characters like the angled brackets by writing code like <code>if(/^[a-zA-Z0-9- ]*$/.test(str) == false) { response.send('{"error":"Could you please write your message with just alphabets and numbers?"}'); } </code> </li>
		</ul>
		</li>

		<li><p><strong>Allowing Non-numerical Values as Latitude and Longitude</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>The issue was also found on <a href="https://vast-peak-9452.herokuapp.com">https://vast-peak-9452.herokuapp.com</a> which uses the 'GET / - Home, the root, the index' API.</li>
			<li>Low: I don't think this is really a security issue, as strings are not getting entered, but I think the input values for 'lat' and 'lng' should be checked more thoroughly. </li>
			<li>Using Postman, I entered <code>&lt;script&gt;alert('Hey Steven');&lt;/script&gt;</code> as the value for the 'lat' key this time. The value for 'lat' was written as NaN both on the web page and in the database. On Mapchat page, the latitude for the location of the message was deciphered as 0.</li>
			<li>Screenshots on what happened:</li>

			<td><img src="screenshot6.png" alt="NaN went into the database" title="NaN went into the database" /></td>
			<table>
			<tr>
			<td><img src="screenshot4.png" alt="On Mapchat page" title="On Mapchat page" /></td>
			<td><img src="screenshot5.png" alt="On Server app page" title="On Server app page" /></td>
			</tr>
			</table>

			<li>We can write code like <code> else if(validator.isNull(login) || validator.isNull(message)
			   || validator.isNull(lat) || validator.isNull(lng) 
			   || !validator.isFloat(lat) || !validator.isFloat(lng)) { response.send(errorText); return; } </code></li>
		</ul>
		</li>

				<li><p><strong>Cross Origin Resource Sharing</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Perhaps the application is letting in too many people, who may not have authority to use the application, the right to input data. The line <code>response.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');</code> for POST and GET latest.json API's is possibly allowing too many domains. The access to input should only be given to the trusted domains or users by modifying the line like <code>response.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'http://foo.example/id=mchow');</code>
		</ul>
		</li>

	</ol>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The vulnerability issues above were found in about 10 hours. With more discussions with other security consultants, we can probably find more security issues. If the web applications were planned to be used as a business tool, security attacks could result in losing a lot of money. Discuss with a few more security consultants as well for more inspections.</p>
