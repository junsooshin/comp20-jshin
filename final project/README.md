# WMFO Program Finder

- Worked with Peter Lee, Rachel Marison, and Steven Manwaring.

- The team discussed the architecture of the program together. I was responsible
for making a page with information of each show (showinfo.html).

- The entire project is not published publicly because of possible security 
and/or licensing issues.

- The png files show what the project looks like.

## Problem Statement:

It's hard to know which WMFO radio programs play the music you like.  

## Solution:

An application that uses data from WMFO playlists to create informative charts 
and graphs that show which genres of music are popular on a given Tufts program.
Users can search for programs that match their taste in music.
